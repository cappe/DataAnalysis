# K-nearest neighbor

This repository includes different implementations of K-nearest neighbor algorithm using Python. The exercises were done for the school class where we were given prediction problems and datasets for constructing prediction models. The datasets are included in the code/ directory inside each exercise, except for the exercise 3. The dataset is not yet publicly available as it is being used for academic purposes, at least for the time being. In addition, each exercise is briefly documented in case interested.
